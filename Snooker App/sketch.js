/*Commentary on Snooker App Design

The snooker app I designed is tailored to meet the project requirements while focusing on simplicity and functionality. It features an intuitive control system that uses mouse interactions for key gameplay mechanics, complemented by clear on-screen instructions to guide players.

The app allows players to position the cue ball within the "D" zone by clicking with the mouse. This approach was chosen because it offers a straightforward and precise way for users to interact with the game. Once the ball is placed, players can strike it either by clicking the mouse again or by pressing the spacebar, giving them flexibility in how they play. Aiming is handled entirely with the mouseâ€”players can adjust the angle of the cue stick by moving the cursor. This method closely mimics real-life snooker, creating a smooth and immersive experience.

Instructions for playing the game are displayed in the top-left corner of the screen. They explain how to position the ball, aim, and strike, making it easy for users to get started without needing external help. Having these instructions visible at all times ensures players can quickly pick up the controls and enjoy the game.

The decision to make mouse controls the primary interaction method was deliberate. It keeps the gameplay simple and precise, making it accessible for both beginners and more experienced players. This straightforward control system lets players focus on the game itself without being overwhelmed by complicated mechanics.

Looking ahead, I plan to expand the app with additional features to enhance the experience. One idea is to introduce a dark mode, which would not only provide an option for low-light environments but also give the app a modern and polished appearance. Another planned extension is the addition of more obstacles, such as moving barriers or rotating blocks, which would make the game even more challenging. These features aim to keep the gameplay fresh and engaging, encouraging players to keep improving their skills.

In summary, the app stays true to the core requirements while remaining simple. The planned extensions, such as dark mode and additional obstacles, will make the app even more dynamic and appealing in the future.
